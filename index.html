    <p>I enjoy playing games most days to pass the times, specifically racing, fighting or platormers. My interest in seeing things work after building them up from nothing. This lead to me picking up coding resulting in me here now pusuing computer science. In working on the Jamaica College robotics team, though as an engineer I took joy in viewing the works of the programmers which lead to me following through in my choice to be a computer scientist. As time went on and searching more and more for programs, games, videos and so forth, i found the difference in creativity amongst website was quite interesting and in seeing the subject selections over the summer passed i found it would be within my best interest to consider if not do this subject, which lead to taking up this course.</p>
